💡 **Reusability & DRY Principle**: Focused on creating modular components, reusable functions, and shared utilities to keep the codebase clean.

💡 **Optimized Caching & Async Operations**: Utilized **RTK Query** for efficient data fetching, caching, and management of async operations.

💡 **Custom Hooks**: Developed custom hooks to encapsulate complex logic, improving code readability and reusability.

💡 **Clear Structure**: Organized files into clear categories like **utilities**, **pages**, and **components** for easy navigation and scalability.

💡 **Meaningful Naming Conventions**: Used intuitive variable and function names to improve collaboration and simplify future maintenance.
